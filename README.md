Robotics with Ros Operating System and Catkin_Ws workspace-

In this program i build four nodes :

(1)The first node will use OpenCV to read the attached image -colors.jpg, and publish it on a topic. 

(2)The second node will be used to read a color from the input, and publish it on a topic. 

(3)The third node will subscribe to both topics, receive the image and the color, find the coordinates for the center of the circle with this color and itâ€™s radius. The coordinates will be advertised on a new topic. 

(4)The last node will receive the coordinates and radius, recieve the image from the first topic, draw a circle around the circle of the selected color and save the new image to a file. 

In order to use it install ROS OS & Catkin_Ws at: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation
